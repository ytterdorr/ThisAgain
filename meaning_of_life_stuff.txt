// ON being alive/memory
"It's funny, I have a lot of memories, but can't know for certain that I have lived. 
Maybe I was just created a moment ago. Who knows?"

I am thinking, so thererfore I am. But am I really thinking? 
What is this 'I' I am talking about? 
Maybe we are all just living in a simulation?
